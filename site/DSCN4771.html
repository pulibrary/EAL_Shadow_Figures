      <dd>Blade Mountain property. Black mountain covered with ochre blade tips and several impaled victims with wrists bound behind back. Top figure sits, ¾ face, unbound hair, bluish trousers rolled to knees. Nearby headless figure, legs up, and upside down impaled head is found near bottom of mountain. These two figures are hinged to edge of mountain and can disappear into the hill or not. Figure with legs up and impaled through back. Figure with wrists bound to ankles impaled through head and chest to back. Female figure with red pantaloons, red bound feet impaled through one buttock, shin, and shoulder. All three figures can suddenly appear from nowhere by the pulling of strings attached to black shapes cut larger than the dimensions of each figure, but exposing any blades. These are kept in place by rawhide flaps sewn to mountain. Sewn hinges allow entire piece to fold into three pieces.
